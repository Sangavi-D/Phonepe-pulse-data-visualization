# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exporation:A User-Friendly Tool using Streamlit and Plotly

The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.


## Getting started

1) Install/Import necessary libraries:GitPython,Pandas,MySQL,mysql-connector-python, Plotly and Streamlit

2) Ensure you have access to MySQL server and set up MySQL DBMS on your local environment.
## Approach

1. Data extraction: Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.
2. Data transformation: Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.
3. Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.
4. Dashboard creation: Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. 
5. Data retrieval: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. 
## Tools Expertise

Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL,
mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.
## Result

The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays
information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive
and visually appealing manner.This project will be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution
for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github
repository.
